While creating the website I learnt:
- React Functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
- Deploying websites to extremely fast servers and giving them a custom domain name.
